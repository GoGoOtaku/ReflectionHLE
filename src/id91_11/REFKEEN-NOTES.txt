Preface
=======

This file, and related notes, intend to cover changes in behaviors and/or
code structures to involved program, in comparison to the original versions.

Please note that while the information given here might appear to be useful,
any subset of it might be wrong and/or outdated at any given time.
Regardless, it should still be a good way to show some of the
technical problems with mimicking the original behaviors
of a program, including vanilla bugs.

General changes
===============

- Disabling unused code and definitions.

- The occasional fix for an unaligned read/write,
as well as other modifications done for portability.

- Extended user input support mostly separate from the original code
(game controllers, multi-touch).

- There's currently no full emulation of EGA plane maintenance. Instead,
routines that output to the desired planes are used. Macros like EGAWRITEMODE
are no-ops.

- Changes that assist with building code originally written in C as C++,
or even just resolving what are technically undefined behaviors.
One example is id_in.c:ASCIINames changing from a byte array to a char array,
so we may define it with char literals without using separate casts.

- id_ca.* and more: Modifications for support of multiple versions.

- id_mm.c was adjusted for the purpose of porting to modern platforms,
while still trying to not change too much of the code.

- id_sd* and more: Direct accesses to the TimeCount variable were adjusted
for the purpose of getting a functional port.

- id_sd.c: OPL delays are done via the separate game-agnostic code.
As of writing this, they only impact the sound output, not in-game timing.

- id_sd.c:SDL_DetectAdLib: It simply checks if OPL emulation is needed
and enabled now.

- id_sd.c:SD_Shutdown: BE_ST_StopAudioAndTimerInt/BE_ST_StopDigiAudioInt is
called earlier, just to make sure there's no deadlock while audio is "locked".

- id_us_1.c:US_FinishTextScreen: Code originally disabled in Catacomb 3D v1.22
is technically re-enabled, but the function is actually not call at all
for this version.

- id_us_2.c:USL_HandleError has a few differences related to error number.
Additionally, there's the lack of a clear replacement for sys_errlist,
so an "unknown" error string is printed the port instead.

- id_vw_ae.c:VWL_XORBuffer: Renamed from BufferToScreen, due to practically
being used just for xor, and being more consistent with the CGA counterpart.
The latter is actually more relevant for Keen Dreams.

Bug fixes with no practical impacts on behaviors
================================================

- id_ca.c:GRFILEPOS would originally read 4 bytes from a buffer beginning
at grstarts. However, grstarts represents an array of 3 bytes long integers.
Just in case of a possible overflow, this was replaced with a copy of 3 bytes.

- id_in.c:IN_ReadControl: Originally, realdelta could be uninitialized
in case of demo playback for Catacomb 3D, but this is never the case in the
game as originally released. The var is still initialized now, just in case.
This fix was actually independently applied to the Adventure Series.

- id_mm.c: The FREEBLOCK macro was modified, adding a check that x->useptr is
non-null before modifying *x->useptr. Originally, if it were null, it'd just
modify a few bytes at dseg:0000, which should already be set to 0,
unless unexpectedly modified earlier.

- id_us.c:US_(C)Print: Modified to accept a string via a pointer to const,
while not temporarily modifying it.

- id_us.c:US_CPrintLine: Like US_Print, using an additional parameter.

- id_vw.c:VWL_MeasureString, id_vw_ae.c:VW_DrawPropString:
Like US_Print, using an additional parameter.

Bugs fixes which might have impacts on behaviors
================================================

- id_sd.c:SD_SetSoundMode: result is now always initialized. Previously,
it could be accessed while uninitialized if SD_SetSoundMode was called
with sdm_AdLib, but AdLibPresent was false.

- id_sd.c:SD_SetSoundMode: tableoffset is set to 0 if called with sdm_Off.
In practice, there was no impact, due to SD_PlaySound checking if SoundMode
is sdm_Off before reading SoundTable.

- id_sd.c:SD_SetMusicMode: result is now always initialized. Previously,
if could be accessed while uninitialized if SD_SetMusicMode was called
with smm_AdLib, but AdLibPresent was false.

- id_us_1.c: ParmStrings and ParmStrings2 were originally not null-terminated,
leading to possible overflows in calls to US_CheckParm from US_TextScreen and
and US_Startup. They were null-terminated in the port.

- id_us_1.c:US_CheckParm: The while loop first checks if *parm is non-null.

- id_us_1.c:US_CPrintLine: It was found out to be called with a null pointer
as the string from c4_play.c:PlayLoop, via DisplaySMsg(NULL,NULL).
For now, this was fixed to replaced the pointer with an empty string.

- id_vw_ae.c:VW_SetScreen: The call to VW_WaitVBL may lead to different
behaviors. Also, calling it before BE_ST_EGASetPelPanning, which would be
closer to the original code in structure, was found to lead to horizontal
scrolling glitches in the Keen Dreams port.

Changes for compatibility
=========================

- Instead of writing &PrintX to the saved game, the original 16-bit offset
pointer value from the matching DOS EXE is written. The "oldtest" field
was renamed "oldtestoffset" to clarify that. id_us_1.c:USL_CheckSavedGames
similarly compares the loaded oldtestoffset value to the matching
16-bit offset value of &PrintX.

- id_vw_ae.c:VW_DrawTile8: It turned out that STARTTILE8 was unexpectedly wrong
in Catacomb Abyss v1.13/v1.24, albeit only in the assembly code. An adjustment
was added to the C port, even though STARTTILE8 is practically never used
in Catacomb Abyss.
