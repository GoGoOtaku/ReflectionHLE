Preface
=======

This file, and related notes, intend to cover changes in behaviors and/or
code structures to involved program, in comparison to the original versions.

Please note that while the information given here might appear to be useful,
any subset of it might be wrong and/or outdated at any given time.
Regardless, it should still be a good way to show some of the
technical problems with mimicking the original behaviors
of a program, including vanilla bugs.

General changes
===============

- Disabling unused code and definitions.

- The occasional fix for an unaligned read/write,
as well as other modifications done for portability.

- Extended user input support mostly separate from the original code
(game controllers, multi-touch).

- There's currently no full emulation of EGA plane maintenance. Instead,
routines that output to the desired planes are used. Macros like EGAWRITEMODE
are no-ops.

- Changes that assist with building code originally written in C as C++, or
even just resolving what are technically undefined behaviors.
One example is id_in.c:ASCIINames changing from a byte array to a char array,
so we may define it with char literals without using separate casts.
Another one is in id_us.c:USL_FindRect, originally using Motion
enum variables as loop variables, now re-defined as int instead.

- id_ca.* and more: Modifications for support of multiple versions,
like CA_CacheMarks accepts an additional argument which is ignored,
say, for Keen Dreams v1.00. Another example is GRMODE being
a variable instead of a macro, plus fakecgamode.

- id_mm.c was adjusted for the purpose of porting to modern platforms,
while still trying to not change too much of the code.

- id_sd* and more: Direct accesses to the TimeCount variable were adjusted
for the purpose of getting a functional port.

- id_sd.c: OPL delays are done via the separate game-agnostic code.
As of writing this, they only impact the sound output, not in-game timing.

- id_sd.c:SDL_ALPlaySound: Before an abnormal quit,
BE_ST_UnlockAudioRecursively might be called even if "asm popf" was not
originally used, just to make things safer and more usable in a source port.

- id_sd.c:SDL_DetectAdLib: It simply checks if OPL emulation is needed
and enabled now.

- id_sd.c:SD_Startup will set SoundSourcePresent to false
if ssNoCheck is false.

- id_sd.c:SD_Startup will set SoundBlasterPresent to true if alNoCheck and
sbNoCheck are false, and SDL_DetectAdLib returns true in AdLibPresent.

- id_sd.c:SD_Shutdown: BE_ST_StopAudioAndTimerInt/BE_ST_StopDigiAudioInt is
called earlier, just to make sure there's no deadlock while audio is "locked".

- id_us.c: When used with the 2015 port's data, new settings like fullscreen
toggle are read from the port's configuration, while ignoring the ones in
KDREAMS.CFG. On the other hand, they're still written to KDREAMS.CFG.

- id_us.c: For he 2015 port, scancodes are converted from SDL2 to DOS when
reading config file; Same when writing, but in the opposite direction.
Some information may get lost as a consequence.

- id_us.c, kd_main.c: US_UpdateTextScreen is technically not a no-op anymore,
not even in v1.05. On the other hand, the function isn't called in v1.05.

- id_us.c:USL_HandleError has a few differences related to error number.
Additionally, there's the lack of a clear replacement for sys_errlist,
so an "unknown" error string is printed the port instead.

- id_vw_ae.c:VWL_XORBuffer: Renamed from BufferToScreen, due to practically
being used just for xor, and being more consistent with the CGA counterpart.

- kd_demo.c:DemoLoop_New: When the code used for showing credits is in use,
it's currently used exclusively for the 2015 port's data, so look for two
credits screens.

Bug fixes with no practical impacts on behaviors
================================================

- id_in.c:IN_ReadCursor technically had reads of uninitialized vars, later
removed in Catacomb 3-D. These reads only existed for halving the values of
the vars, though, and they were immediately replaced with updated values from
the mouse, with no impact.

- id_in.c:IN_ReadControl: Originally, realdelta could be uninitialized
in case of demo playback, but this is never the case in Keen Dreams as
originally released. The var is still initialized now, just in case.

- id_mm.c:MM_FreePtr: Order of operands in while loop was swapped,
fixing a possible null pointer dereference (observed while adding
support for the 2015 port's data).

- id_us.c:US_(C)Print: Modified to accept a string via a pointer to const,
while not temporarily modifying it.

- id_us.c:US_CPrintLine: Like US_Print, using an additional parameter.

- id_us.c:US_ControlPanel: lasttime and lasti are not left uninitialized.
In practice, FlushHelp was originally initialized to true, and may change
to false only when approaching the first loop iteration, where this also
leads to updates of lasttime and lasti.

- id_us.c:US_ControlPanel: Also not left uninitialized is lastn.
In practice, when inrect is set to true for the first time, lasti will differ
from i (since lasti is set to -2), so lastn won't even be inspected.
It'll still be set (to the value of n), so it should be covered.

- id_us.c:US_DisplayHighScores: y is not left uninitialized. However, it may
be read only if which != -1. In such a case, the loop will eventually reach an
iteration i such that i == which, so y will be set to PrintY before it's read.

- id_vw.c:VWL_MeasureString, id_vw_ac.c:VW_DrawPropString_CGA,
id_vw_ae.c:VW_DrawPropString_EGA: Like US_Print, using an additional parameter.

- id_vw.c:VWL_MeasureString,
id_vw_ac.c:VW_DrawPropString_CGA, id_vw_ae.c:VW_DrawPropString_EGA:
As in the Catacombs, cast each character to an unsigned byte.
Reason is that for C++ compatibility (and reducing C warnings),
the string was changed from a uint8_t pointer to a char pointer,
so the values might be signed.

kd_act1.c:ChangeState: Before inspecting state->rightshapenum, it is now
verified that state is non-null. Originally, rightshapenum was in the first
4 bytes of the state struct. The first 4 bytes of the null address with the
original DOS versions were set to 0, unless mistakenly overwritten.

kd_play.c:ClipToWalls: ob->state->pushtofloor would be read even if ob->state
was null. In such a case, ob->state->pushtofloor would be a part of a small
Borland C++ string, unless somehow overwritten. So, it is now checked if
ob->state is null, in addition to checking that ob->state->pushtofloor is not.

kd_play.c:DoActor: In addition to checking if state->progress == think
(i.e., 2), it is now also checked that state is not-null. If it is, then due
to the layout of statetype, it should differ unless overwritten.

kd_play.c:DoActor: A check that state is non-null before reading state->tictime
was similarly added. Additionally, newtics is compared to a magic value which
should match the one following a null-pointer dereference, assuming that
it wasn't modified earlier.
Tthere's also another separate check that state is non-null, before accessing
state->progress. If it were dereferenced with the original EXEs, it wouldn't be
a valid progress enum value, anyway (assuming it wasn't overwritten).

kd_play.c:StateMachine: state is again checked for being non-null before
reading state->skippable. As usual, this should behave like the original
EXEs if ((statetype *)0)->skippable isn't overwritten.

Bugs fixes which might have impacts on behaviors
================================================

- id_sd.c:SD_SetSoundMode: result is now always initialized. Previously,
it could be accessed while uninitialized if SD_SetSoundMode was called
with sdm_AdLib, but AdLibPresent was false.

- id_sd.c:SD_SetSoundMode: tableoffset is set to 0 if called with sdm_Off.
In practice, there was no impact, due to SD_PlaySound checking if SoundMode
is sdm_Off before reading SoundTable.

- id_sd.c:SD_SetMusicMode: result is now always initialized. Previously,
if could be accessed while uninitialized if SD_SetMusicMode was called
with smm_AdLib, but AdLibPresent was false.

- id_us.c:US_CheckParm: The while loop first checks if *parm is non-null.

- id_us.c:USL_CtlDEButtonCustom: result is always initialized to false,
ven if the user decided to quit, and then it might not matter at all
in the original EXEs.

- id_vw_ae.c:VW_SetScreen_EGA: The call to VW_WaitVBL may lead to different
behaviors. Also, calling it before BE_ST_EGASetPelPanning, which would be
closer to the original code in structure, was found to lead to horizontal
scrolling glitches in the port.

soft.c:BLoad could re-open a file via CA_LoadFile without closing an already
open file for the same filename. The file is now closed beforehand.

Changes for compatibility
=========================

- The statetype struct has an additional field for the original values
of pointers to such states in the DOS versions, for the purpose of
compatibility with original saved games.

- id_rf.c: The map's info plane consist of 16-bit values, even for pointers to
allanims array elements. The pointer values in use should match the originals
for compatibility with saved games. They're converted when needed.

- jam_io.*, loadscn2.c and possibly more: Uses of file handles were converted
to our own contained around pointers to FILE. DEST_FILE/SRC_FILE may still be
used internally, instead of DEST_FFILE/SRC_FFILE, for compatibility.

- Like the allanims pointers, pointers to objects may be converted for
compatibility.

- statetype has temp2 and temp2stateptr for flowers.
